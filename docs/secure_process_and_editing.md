# Secure Process Management and Code Editing Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for implementing secure process management and code editing capabilities within the Intu TUI. This system will enable users to spawn processes and edit code directly from the UI with appropriate safety measures and permission controls.

## Goals

- Enable secure process spawning and management from the Intu TUI
- Provide code editing capabilities within the TUI
- Implement a comprehensive permission system to ensure safety
- Maintain audit trails of all sensitive operations
- Balance security with usability

## Permission System

### Permission Types

- `FILE_READ`: Permission to read files
- `FILE_WRITE`: Permission to modify or create files
- `PROCESS_EXEC`: Permission to execute processes
- `NETWORK`: Permission to access network resources

### Permission Storage

- Permissions will be stored in `~/.intu/permissions.yaml`
- Format will support both allow-lists and block-lists
- Example structure:

```yaml
file_permissions:
  allow:
    - path: "/home/user/projects/intu"
      access: "read-write"
    - path: "/home/user/projects/otherproject"
      access: "read-only"
  deny:
    - path: "/home/user/.ssh"
    - path: "/etc"

process_permissions:
  allow:
    - command: "git"
      args: ["status", "diff", "add", "commit"]
    - command: "npm"
      args: ["run", "test"]
  deny:
    - command: "rm"
      args: ["-rf", "/"]

network_permissions:
  allow:
    - host: "api.github.com"
    - host: "registry.npmjs.org"
  deny:
    - host: "suspicious-site.com"
```

### Permission Scopes

- **Global**: Applied system-wide
- **Directory-specific**: Applied only to certain directories
- **Command-specific**: Applied only to certain commands
- **Time-limited**: Valid only for a specific duration or session

### Permission Request Flow

1. Operation is requested by user or AI system
2. Permission service checks if operation is allowed
3. If not explicitly allowed, user is prompted with detailed permission request
4. User can grant permission (one-time, session, or permanent)
5. Decision is logged and optionally saved to permissions file
6. Operation proceeds if allowed, otherwise is blocked

## Process Management

### Core Components

- **Process Manager**: Handles process lifecycle, creation, monitoring, and termination
- **Sandbox Environment**: Provides isolation for running processes
- **Resource Controller**: Enforces limits on CPU, memory, and execution time
- **Output Capture**: Captures and formats stdout/stderr for display in the TUI

### Safety Measures

- Resource limits for all spawned processes
- Timeout mechanisms to prevent runaway processes
- Signal handling for proper process termination
- Process isolation to prevent system-wide effects
- Command whitelisting and blacklisting

### Process Lifecycle

1. Process request is validated against permissions
2. Process is created with appropriate resource limits
3. Output is streamed to TUI in real-time
4. Lifecycle events (start, exit, error) are tracked and displayed
5. Process can be terminated by user at any time
6. All process executions are logged for audit purposes

## Edit Operations

### Editing Capabilities

- File content modification with proper validation
- Directory and file creation/deletion with safety checks
- Atomic write operations to prevent corruption
- Mandatory backups before significant changes
- Version control integration (git) where applicable

### Safety Measures

- Diff-based file modifications for transparency
- Writing to temporary files before moving to final location
- Automatic backup creation before edits
- Size limits for file operations
- Path validation to prevent unauthorized access

### Edit Workflow

1. Edit request is validated against permissions
2. For existing files, a backup is created
3. Requested changes are applied to a temporary file
4. Diff is shown to user for confirmation if configured
5. Upon confirmation, changes are atomically applied
6. Edit operation is logged for audit purposes

## Security Architecture

### Privilege Separation

- UI layer has minimal privileges
- Operation execution layer has controlled access to system resources
- Permission layer mediates all sensitive operations
- Audit layer records all activities independently

### Security Controls

- Secure IPC channel for command requests
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Process identity verification
- Fine-grained access control
- Input sanitization to prevent command injection

### Audit Trail

- All sensitive operations logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - User identity
  - Operation details
  - Permission context
  - Result status
- Logs stored securely with tamper-evidence

## UI Components

### Permission Management UI

- Permission request dialogs with clear scope explanation
- Current permission status indicators
- Permission management interface for reviewing/revoking permissions

### Process UI

- Process output windows with real-time updates
- Process status indicators
- Process control buttons (terminate, pause, resume)
- Resource usage visualization

### Code Editor UI

- Syntax highlighting for common languages
- Line numbering
- Search and replace functionality
- Diff visualization for changes
- Integration with version control

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. Create permission system infrastructure
2. Implement basic process spawning with safety measures
3. Build file operation primitives with safety checks
4. Develop initial permission request UI

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

1. Enhance process management with resource controls
2. Implement code editing with syntax highlighting
3. Add atomic file operations and backups
4. Build comprehensive audit logging

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Add version control integration
2. Implement advanced editor features
3. Create permission management UI
4. Develop detailed resource monitoring

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Choices

- **Process Management**: Use Go's `os/exec` with enhanced safety wrappers
- **File Operations**: Custom wrappers around Go's file I/O for safety
- **Permission System**: YAML-based configuration with in-memory caching
- **TUI Components**: Extend current Bubble Tea components for new UI elements

### Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous process handling to keep UI responsive
- Efficient output capturing to handle high-volume output
- Optimized permission checking for frequent operations
- Lazy loading of larger files for editing

### Security Considerations

- Regular security audits of implementation
- Clear separation between trusted and untrusted components
- Principle of least privilege throughout the system
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers

## Conclusion

This design provides a comprehensive approach to implementing secure process management and code editing capabilities within the Intu TUI. By focusing on permissions, safety, and usability, the system will enable powerful functionality while maintaining appropriate security controls.
