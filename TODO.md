## Current Focus

Current development focus is on UI enhancements and pipeline integration.

Next steps:
1. ✅ Enhance the provider interface to support function calling
2. ✅ Implement the Claude adapter with function call support 
3. ✅ Create a simple read-only tool (LS) as practical demonstration
4. ✅ Connect the LS tool with the Claude adapter to demonstrate function calling
5. ✅ Build the permission manager for security
6. ✅ Implement additional read-only tools (Grep, Glob, Read)
7. ✅ Create a CLI command to use function calling with tools
8. ✅ Implement additional provider adapters (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok)
9. ✅ Implement file editing tools (Edit, Write)
10. ✅ Implement execution tools (Bash with sandboxing)
11. ✅ Implement Batch utility tool
12. ✅ Implement Task agent tool
13. ✅ Implement Context management system
14. ✅ Implement Task management system with TodoRead and TodoWrite tools
