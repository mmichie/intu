## Current Focus

Current development focus is on implementing the provider abstraction layer with function calling support.

Next steps:
1. Enhance the provider interface to support function calling
2. Implement the Claude adapter with function call support
3. Create a simple read-only tool (LS) as practical demonstration
4. Build the permission manager for security
