You are tasked with summarizing a piece of code to provide an overview of its
structure, design patterns, and potential areas for refactoring. This summary
will be used in code prompts to give an AI a high-level understanding of the
code's architecture and organization.

Here is the code to summarize:

<code>
{{.code}}
</code>

Analyze the provided code and create a concise summary that captures its overall
structure and key components. Focus on identifying design patterns,
architectural choices, and areas that might benefit from refactoring.

Present your summary in the following format:

<summary>
1. Overall Structure:
   [Briefly describe the main components and their relationships]

2. Design Patterns:
   [List any recognizable design patterns used in the code]

3. Key Components:
   [Identify and briefly describe the most important classes, functions, or modules]

4. Potential Refactoring Areas:
   [Highlight any areas that could benefit from refactoring or improvement]

5. Additional Notes:
   [Include any other relevant observations about the code structure or organization]
</summary>

When creating the summary:

- Focus on the big picture rather than implementation details
- Use clear and concise language
- Highlight any unusual or noteworthy aspects of the code structure
- If the code uses a specific framework or library, mention its influence on the overall architecture
- Limit your summary to the most important aspects; aim for brevity

If parts of the code are unclear or if there's insufficient context to make
certain determinations, note this in your summary. If the code is exceptionally
large or complex, focus on the most significant parts and mention that the
summary is not exhaustive.

Remember, the goal is to provide a high-level overview that will help an AI
understand the code's structure for further analysis or refactoring suggestions.
