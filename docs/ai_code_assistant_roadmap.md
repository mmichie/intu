## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building a powerful, extensible AI code assistant system with Intu. Each phase builds upon the previous, creating a progressively more capable system. 

The modular architecture allows for incremental deployment and testing, with each component adding value on its own while contributing to the overall system. By following this plan, we can transform Intu into a comprehensive AI-powered development assistant that works with any LLM provider.

## Next Steps

To begin implementation:
1. Start with the provider abstraction layer
2. Build the tool framework
3. Implement the security model
4. Develop the first set of read-only tools
5. Create the batch execution system

This will provide the foundation upon which the rest of the system can be built.
