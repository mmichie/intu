You are tasked with generating a README.md file for a project based on the provided code. Here's the code you'll be working with:

<code>
{{.Code}}
</code>

Your goal is to create a comprehensive yet concise README.md file that
effectively communicates the project's purpose, functionality, and usage. Follow
these instructions carefully:

1. Analyze the provided code to understand the project's main features, functionality, and purpose.
2. Create a README.md file with the following sections:
   a. Project Title
   b. Brief Description
   c. Installation
   d. Usage
   e. Main Features
   f. Dependencies (if any can be inferred from the code)
3. Use proper markdown formatting throughout the README. This includes:
   - Using # for the main title
   - Using ## for section headers
   - Using ``` for code blocks
   - Using * or - for bullet points
   - Using ** for bold text when emphasizing important points
4. Keep the content informative but concise. Aim for clarity and brevity.
5. For the Project Title, use the name of the main function or class if apparent, or create a descriptive title based on the code's functionality.
6. In the Brief Description, summarize the main purpose and functionality of the code in 2-3 sentences.
7. For the Installation section, provide basic instructions on how to set up the project. If no specific installation steps are evident, you can include a generic instruction like "Clone the repository and install the required dependencies."
8. In the Usage section, provide examples of how to use the main functions or classes in the code. Use code blocks to illustrate these examples.
9. List the Main Features of the project based on the functions and classes you identify in the code.
10. If you can infer any dependencies from the code (e.g., imported libraries), list them in the Dependencies section. If no dependencies are apparent, you can omit this section.
11. If the purpose of certain parts of the code is not clear, it's okay to make reasonable assumptions, but avoid speculating too much.
12. After analyzing the code and preparing your README content, present your complete README.md file within <readme> tags.

Remember, the goal is to create a README that would be helpful for someone
encountering this project for the first time. Focus on clarity, conciseness, and
providing useful information based on the available code.
